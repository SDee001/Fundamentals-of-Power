##  About the Project
EE-Collective is a student-driven initiative to create high-quality, openly accessible learning material for Electrical Engineering students — written *by* EE students, *for* EE students.

This project consists of two complementary books:

| Book | Status | Format |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Fundamentals of Power** | Published |Web version |
| **SCI Lab Tutorials** | In development |Web version (coming soon) |

##  Purpose
- Make power systems & simulations easier to understand
- Replace scattered resources with a structured, practical learning path
- Bridge theory → real institute data → simulation with SCI Lab
- Provide something future juniors can build upon
